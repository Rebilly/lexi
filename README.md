## Readability scores

The [text-readability](https://github.com/clearnote01/readability) library is used to determine the complexity and ease of reading for your documentation files. These scores can be used as a guide to help you understand how changes may impact the readability of your documentation.

## Usage

### Inputs

| Name           | Necessity | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| -------------- | --------- |-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `github-token` | Required  | The GitHub token used to post the report comment to the pull request. The [GitHub Actions token](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/authentication-in-a-workflow#about-the-github_token-secret) can be used with `${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}`. |
| `glob`         | Required  | The glob pattern to use for matching Markdown files you want analysed                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `test`      | Run the unit tests                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| `format`    | Run prettier on all files                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `build`     | build the dist file. You are required to run this locally in order to build the dist before opening a PR.                                                                                                                                       |
| `run:local` | Run the action on two local folders, for testing and development. The first argument is the old ("base branch") folder and the sedcond argument is the new ("head branch") folder. For example `yarn run:local ./test-data/old ./test-data/new` |

### Testing

When developing the action, it can be useful to be able to run it locally rather than pushing a branch and running your development version on GitHub.

You can test the action locally by running the `run:local` command. This will report readability on two different folders, as if they were a pull request.

For example: `yarn run:local ./test-data/old ./test-data/new`
